This repository is a comprehensive evaluation of climate data from 36 weather stations across France to understand the countryâ€™s diverse climatic conditions. The dataset encompasses various parameters, including station name, altitude, latitude, longitude, mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, mean precipitation, maximum precipitation within 24 hours, number of rainy days, and annual sunshine hours.

Multiple linear regression was used to model mean temperature as a function of altitude, latitude, and longitude. This summary statistic of the model was used to quantify how these predictors influence the temperature variations across the 18 administrative geographic regions within the country. Higher altitudes were found to correlate with lower temperatures, while latitude also plays a significant role in determining climate, with temperatures generally decreasing as one moves away from the equator. Longitude also contributes to having lower temperature, but its result is not statistically significant
